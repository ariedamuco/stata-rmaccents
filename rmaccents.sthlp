{cmd:rmaccents} {hline 2} Remove accents from text variables.

{title:Syntax}
{pstd}
{cmd:rmaccents} {varlist} [, {opt NEWvar(name)} {opt REPLACE}]

{title:Description}
{pstd}
{cmd:rmaccents} is a tool that removes accents from text variables by replacing accented characters with their unaccented equivalents. You can either replace the original variable(s) or create a new variable(s) with the unaccented version(s).

{title:Options}
{phang}
{opt NEWvar(name)}: Creates a new variable with unaccented text, leaving the original variable(s) intact. If the new variable name already exists, the program will throw an error.

{phang}
{opt REPLACE}: Replaces the original variable(s) with the unaccented version(s).

{title:Remarks}
{pstd}
This package is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that contain accented characters in names, city names, country names, or other text fields, especially if downstream processes require unaccented text.

{title:Examples}
{pstd}
{phang}
Replace accented characters in the original variable:
{pstd}
{cmd:. rmaccents name, replace}

{phang}
Create a new variable without accents:
{pstd}
{cmd:. rmaccents name, newvar(name_noaccent)}

{phang}
Handle multiple variables (e.g., names of cities and countries):
{pstd}
{cmd:. rmaccents name city country, replace}

{phang}
Create new variables for multiple variables:
{pstd}
{cmd:. rmaccents name city country, newvar(name_noaccent city_noaccent country_noaccent)}
